    <h1><font face="Bree Serif" color="white" >Biography</font></h1>
    <p align="center"><font face="Bree Serif" color="white" size="3">Steve Jobs, the American businessman and technology visionary<br> who is best known as the co-founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of Apple Inc, was born on February 24, 1955.<br>
        “When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world.<br> Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That’s a very limited life.<br> Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact:<br> Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.<br> And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.”- Steve Jobs </font>
